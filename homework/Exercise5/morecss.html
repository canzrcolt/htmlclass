      <p class="yellow rounded">
        When a container is created, a very important property that should be
        manipulated is width. Just like if you were designing a real life
        picture frame; you would need to know the width property. Fortunately,
        css allows us to have more than just a width property. The three
        properties involving width in css are: min-width, max-width, width.
        Width is the most simple and creates a static width for the
        container/element that is being manipulated/created. When a value is
        given to the key(width) your object is assigned a specific and
        non-changing width. The two other options, min-width and max-width, are
        there to assign an object a potentially changing width dimension. You
        can choose what the maximum width that the object can be by using the
        max-width property, and similarly choose the min-width of an object
        using the min-width property.

        The box-shadow property is very useful, and can be used to create depth
        and allow a normal 'flat' 2-D box appear to be 3-D by creating a drop
        shadow.

      <p class="seethrough">
        The opacity property allows you to make change the invisibility of a
        component. If something is 100% opaque, you can fully see it. If the
        opacity is 2%, it is very difficult to see, if even visible to the eye.
