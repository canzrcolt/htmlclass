      This List will go on for a long time. I am a very talented kitty cat with
      confidence that can scratch your skin right off. I am very into.....
      myself and very good at it. Probably the best at being into myself.
      Believe me. I will now start just a very short list of my talents, but if
      there’s not a talent listed on here, I’m sure I still have that talent. So
      here is just a very small amount of my talents. Enjoy.
