        Hi, my name is Schoughy Bear Duncan, but you just call me Schough. I was
        found in Kentucky while my lame dad found me in a parking lot. He
        thought I was an abondoned pregnant cat, but i was just a little boy
        kitty with a lot of worms. I like to control things and I will be famous
        one day, I will sacrifice anything. I am currently sponsored by
        <a href="https://bluebuffalo.com/">Blue Buffalo</a> ,but am looking into
        being sponsored by <a href="https://purina.com">Purina</a> or maybe even
        <a href="https://www.petco.com/">Petco</a>
