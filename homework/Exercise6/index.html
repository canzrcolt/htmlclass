          Flexbox layout is the layout that most people say saved CSS's
          reputation. Before Flexbox there were serious issues with getting a
          consistently responsive webpage. Luckily, phones and tablets weren't
          as popular as they are now, but now there is a solution for a
          relatively simple and reliable way. Float is what my coworkers used to
          use before Flex. I have heard nightmare scenarios from that as well.

          Grid Layout is the layout that is an improved version of Flexbox. Not
          only does it replace it, you can actually use them together. Grid
          reminds me of the 3d implementation of Flexbox; assuming Flexbox is
          being viewed as 2d. The reason I compare the two in that way is
          because with flexbox, you can explicitly state how many columns or
          rows you would like. The difference is with Grid you can explicitly
          state how many columns and rows. Grid is great and I am using it to
          replace html tables in a project I am currently working on.
        </p>

          Multiple column layout has a similar idea and syntax as Flex and grid,
          but with a quicker and less strings attached manner. I view Multiple
          column layout as the difference between VS Code (light-weight ide) and
          VS Studio (comes with all bells and whistles). Although there is less
          you can do with Multiple column layout vs flex or grid, sometimes
          being able to quickly spin up a solution can be very handy. Multiple
          column layout is not nearly as popular as flex or grid.
